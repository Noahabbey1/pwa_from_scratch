# Build a PWA from scratch

## Introduction

This guide will help build a very simple PWA from scratch, with the intent of showing you only the wpa related code. Thus, no frameworks or code generators will be used. The HTML and CSS content will be very minimal. This will allow to focus only on the parts that are PWA related.
We are going to practice the following features:

- Add shortcut to home-screen
- Splash-screen (kind of :blush: )
- Service Worker
- Caching

Before getting into the code, let’s prepare our workstation with the necessary elements.

## Requirements

We are going to use Visual Studio Code IDE, and use these languages: HTML 5, CSS3 and EcmaScript 6. Here is the setup that I recommend for this tutorial:

- Visual studio code which will be our IDE
- The following VSCode extensions
  - [Live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer): it allows to run the current workspace on a local server with a single button click
  - Optionally, [JavaScript Snippet Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=akamud.vscode-javascript-snippet-pack) or any other extension that helps you working on web projects.
- A JSON API that you can easily call for the sake of simplicity. There is a GitHub that categorizes some [public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis). In this guide, we are going to use [Jikan API](https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/#reference)
- Latest version of Chrome or Firefox

Once everything is setup and ready, we can initialize the first lines of code.

## Project description and initialization

The PWA that we are going to build is a simple anime search app. It allows to display an anime given its **id**. Thus, it will show and input field and buttons for entering an anime id and validating it. In addition, we will display the search history of the user. The first step consists in adding a manifest that allows to add the PWA to home-screen. Next, a service worker will be added to cache the previous search actions and thus will not fail even in offline mode. To demonstrate the use of caching without service workers, the search history will be cached for offline use.

![app shell](./readme_assets/app_shell.jpg "The anime search web app")

We are going to create the first files and first lines of code of our project. This allows to have some code running and also test our setup before digging into PWA concepts.

Please follow the below steps to get a minimal html website:

- Create an empty folder that will contain our project
- Launch VSCode and open that folder
- Create a new HTML file
- Initialize the file with an HTML snippet (CTRL+SHIFT+P -> type snippet -> choose html)
- Add a **main.js** file and **main.css file** which we will use later

The html file should be similar to this one:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <title>Page Title</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="main.css" />
    <script src="main.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

Let's test the [Live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension by right clicking somewhere on the **Go Live** button on the toolbar. You default browser should render your **index.html** as a blank page.

The serious stuff starts nows :v: with the app shell goodness.

## The app shell

The app shell is defined by [Addy Osmani](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell) as:

> The minimal HTML, CSS and JavaScript required to power the user interface and when cached offline can ensure instant, reliably good performance to users on repeat visits

Here, I try to give a synthetic definition (se excuse me if I'm wrong :smiley: ):

> The app "shell" is the HTML, CSS and JS and media content of a PWA that is:
> - Sufficient for browsing online or offline
> - Minimal
> - Constant

Let me explain these points:

- Sufficient for browsing online or offline: the app shell should be designed in a such a that users can browser all of the content of the website whether online or offline
- Minimal: the app shell is the content that is first loaded when we open a PWA. having a small and optimized app shell means faster load time and smaller caching.
- Constant: since we are going to use the PWA offline, we need to cache some html, css, js and media files to load the app. Having a base content that changes over time makes managing offline mode very complicated. Thus, I consider a good app shell to be constant.

In light of that explanation, the app shell will have a single HTML page with no anime content at all. The anime content will be loaded from the internet or from the cache. The shell will also contain the javascript code that allows to look for anime and maintain a search history. Finally we will add a css file and the static assets to the app Shell.

This app shell will be very small, constant or static and allow us to use all the functions the PWA whether offline or online.

Let's go back to VSCode and these content to the page:

- A button and an input field
- Two empty divs. One for displaying the result of the searched anime (with `id="main_anime"`) and another one for showing the history (with `id="history"`).

The html file should look like this now and it should not change.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <title>Page Title</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="main.css" />
    <script src="main.js"></script>
</head>

<body onload="installServiceWorkerAsync()">
    <div>
        <input id="anime_id_input" placeholder="Anime id" />
        <button id="ok_button" onclick="onOkButtonClickAsync()">OK</button>
    </div>
    <div id="main_anime">
    </div>
    <h1>History</h1>
    <div id="history">

    </div>
</body>

</html>
```

Let's also add some css

```css
#history {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.anime_item {
    margin: 10px;
    width: 250px;
}

.anime_item img {
    width: 80%;
    height: auto;
    /* allows to adapt to browser width */
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

The javascript part of our app shell will be evolving throughout the tutorial. But for now let's do the basic things.

First of all, define the constants and the functions that will generate the anime tags from a single anime object.

```javascript
//create an empty array on startup
let animes = Array()
const API_BASE = "https://api.jikan.me/"
const API_ANIME = API_BASE + "anime/"

/**
 * generate anime tag from a Javascript Object that containt the anime information
 */
function buildAnimeMarkup(anime) {
    return `<div class="anime_item"><img class='anime_image' src=${anime.image_url} />
        <h2 class='anime_name'>${anime.title}</h2>
        <p class='anime_description'>${anime.premiered}</p></div>`
}
```

The `animes` array allows to store the history of searched anime.

You can see here an example of an anime object <https://api.jikan.me/anime/1000>. You can change the at the end to see a different anime.

Here is the code that loads an anime and updates the history when the user clicks on the button:

```javascript
/**
 * update History with new result
 */
function updateHistory(anime) {
    animes.push(anime)
    document.querySelector('#history').innerHTML = buildAnimeMarkup(anime) + document.querySelector('#history').innerHTML
}

/**
 * loadAnAnime from the internet and place it on a target element
 */
async function onOkButtonClickAsync() {
    let targetElementId = '#main_anime'
    let animeId = document.querySelector("#anime_id_input").value
    try {
        const response = await fetch(API_ANIME + animeId)
        if (!response.ok) {
            return
        }
        let anime = await response.json()
        console.log("anime", anime)
        document.querySelector(targetElementId).innerHTML = buildAnimeMarkup(anime)

        updateHistory(anime)
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(`error ${err}`)
    }
}
```

In this code we use the `fetch` API to load content from the server and then display it on the main div and the history div.

As you can see there no manifest, service worker, not cache. It is OK because the app shell is not finalized.

You can test the app right now. It is not yet PWA compliant but we will work on it in the next steps :smirk:.

## The PWA manifest

Our first step in the PWA world is adding a manifest file. Here is its definition from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest):

> The web app manifest provides information about an application (such as name, author, icon, and description) in a JSON text file.

Adding a web manifest gives you other advantages. Here are some of them:

- They allow the user to add a bookmark on your home-screen or desktop
- It allows to display a simple splash-screen while the app is loaded

Since the web manifest is a plain JSON file, we can either write it manually or use a tool to generate it. We are going to use this [Web App Manifest Generator](https://tomitm.github.io/appmanifest/).

![Web App Manifest Generator](./readme_assets/pwa_manifest_generator.png "Web App Manifest Generator")

Using the tool, try to generate the following `JSON` file or a similar one.

```json
{
    "name": "PWA from scratch",
    "short_name": "PWA from 0",
    "lang": "fr",
    "start_url": "/",
    "display": "fullscreen",
    "theme_color": "#c2f442",
    "icons": [{
            "src": "pwa0-64.png",
            "sizes": "64x64"
        },
        {
            "src": "pwa0-128.png",
            "sizes": "128x128"
        },
        {
            "src": "pwa0-512.png",
            "sizes": "512x512"
        }
    ]
}
```

Put that JSON in a file called `manifest.json` and place it in the root of your website.

We will also update the HTML head with the html generated by the tool.

```html
<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json">

<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
<meta name="application-name" content="PWA from scratch">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="PWA from scratch">
<meta name="msapplication-starturl" content="/index.html">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
```

Let's try to open the app on one of your mobile phones browser. After opening the url `MACHINE_IP:PORT`, tap the menu button of your browser and look for the option **Add to home screen**

![Add to home screen](./readme_assets/pwa_install_menu.jpg "dd to home screen")

By choosing this option, you will end up with a link of you PWA on your home screen.

![PWA bookmark](./readme_assets/pwa_bookmark.jpg "PWA bookmark")

Next, open tap on the shortcut. you will see a small loading screen. If your look at the manifest, you can see the effect of entries `theme_color` and `icons`. They allow to customize the loading screen of the PWA.

![Splash-screen](./readme_assets/pwa_splashscreen.jpg "Splash-screen")

Right after that, the fullscreen PWA is shown with all its glory thanks to the `"display": "fullscreen"` option in the manifest.

![PWA run from bookmark](./readme_assets/pwa_chrome_fullscreen.jpg "PWA run from bookmark")

Yaaaay the PWA is now added to my home-screen :heart_eyes:. However, there is no caching right now :unamused:. Let's deal with that next :rocket:.

## Adding a Service Worker

In this step we are going to register a service worker whose implementation is defined in a javascript file that we will call “sw.js”
Define the following function which registers the service worker
Call the function when the document loads
